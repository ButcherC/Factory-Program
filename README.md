# Factory-Program
Factory Pattern program that simulates drawing of widgets and printing documents.
This program uses low or high resolution drivers for printing and displaying, depending on the platform. The Widget class has a draw() method that says a widget is being drawn with either a low or high res driver, and similarly, the Document class has a print() method that says a Document is being printed with a high or low res driver. The resolution setting is read from a file.

Test files for this include: 
HighResolutionTestFile.txt and LowResolutionTestFile.txt
